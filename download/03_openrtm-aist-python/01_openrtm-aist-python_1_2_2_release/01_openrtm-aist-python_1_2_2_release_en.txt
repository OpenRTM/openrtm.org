*** Build from source

For details on how to build from source, see [[Building from source (Windows):/ja/node/6618]] or [[Building from source (Linux):/ja/node/6651]] .

*** Create deb / rpm package

From 1.1, the creation of deb packages for Ubuntu and Debian and rpm packages for Fedora from the above source code is officially supported. &br;
You can create a package by following the steps below. When creating a package, use the Bulk installation script (pkg_install_***.sh) to install the necessary packages in advance.

 $ tar xvzf OpenRTM-aist-Python-1.2.2.tar.gz
 $ cd OpenRTM-aist-Python-1.2.2/packages
 $ make

Packages are created in the pacakges directory.

&color(red){* Install tools such as "dpkg-dev build-essential debhelper devscripts" when creating deb packages on Ubuntu and Debian, and "rpm-build createrepo" before creating rpm packages on Fedora. Must be kept. };
These can be installed by executing [[Bulk nstallation script:/ja/node/6345]] with the -c option.
