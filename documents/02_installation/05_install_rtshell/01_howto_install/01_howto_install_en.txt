To install rtshell, you need to install OpenRTM-aist-Python because rtshell is a Python program. Therefore, to use rtshell, it is required to install OpenRTM-aist-Python and Python execution environment before installing rtshell. (The bulk installation script for Linux installs Python in the script, but in the case of Windows the msi install needs to be installed beforehand. The supported Python version is 3.10, 3.9, 3.8, 3.7.)

** Installation on Windows
Please install OpenRTM-aist by msi installer. Please refer to the following page for the procedure. &br;
[[Let's start OpenRTM-aist in 10 minutes!/Installing OpenRTM-aist:/en/doc/installation/lets_start#toc2]]


** Installation on Linux environment
Running the bulk install script with no arguments installs C ++, Python, Java, OpenRTP (amd64 only), and JDK8, including rtshell.

When installing OpenRTM-aist 2.0 series, paste the following into the shell prompt and execute it.ã€€
 $ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenRTM/OpenRTM-aist/master/scripts/openrtm2_install_ubuntu.sh)

When installing OpenRTM-aist 1.2 series, please execute the following.
 $ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenRTM/OpenRTM-aist/master/scripts/pkg_install_ubuntu.sh)


*** Raspbian case:
Move to the directory where the bulk installation script is downloaded and type in:
 $ sudo sh pkg_install_raspbian.sh -l c++ -l python -l rtshell --yes
 $ sudo rtshell_post_install

Close the terminal once.

Currently, there is an issue with rtshell_post_install on Raspbian.  The following method can make you avoid the problem.
Before closing the terminal, execute rtshell_post_install without "sudo" prefix. And answer ''N'' to the first and the 2nd question. Then answer ''Y'' to the 3rd question like following:
 Link man pages? n
 Link documentation? n
 Add shell support to .bashrc? y
