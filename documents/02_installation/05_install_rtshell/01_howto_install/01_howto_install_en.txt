// Title: How to install

To install rtshell, you need to install OpenRTM-aist-Python because rtshell is a Python program. Therefore, to use rtshell, it is required to install OpenRTM-aist-Python and Python execution environment before installing rtshell. (The bulk installation script for Linux installs Python in the script, but in the case of Windows the msi install needs to be installed beforehand. The supported Python version is 3.7, 3.6, 3.5, 2.7.)

** Installation on Windows
Please install OpenRTM-aist by msi installer. Please refer to the following page for the procedure. &br;
[[OpenRTM-aist 1.2 installation (Windows, using msi installer)>//node/6652]]

*** Check rtcwd command

Check if the rtcwd command can be executed on the command line.
 > rtcwd
 'rtcwd' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
 operable program or batch file.

If you see this message, run rtshell_post_install.
 > rtshell_post_install -n
If Python is installed under Program Files, execute the command prompt as an administrator.

 > rtcwd
 rtcwd: Invalid CORBA naming service: localhost
This message is not a problem because [[Start Name Server:/en/node/7005#toc2]] described in Operation check (Windows) is not executed.

** Installation on Linux environment
Use [[bulk installation script>//node/6990]] to install rtshell with using "-l c++", "-l python" and "-l rtshell" options and then execute rtshell_post_install.

*** Ubuntu 18.04 case:
Move to the directory where the bulk installation script is downloaded and type in:
 $ sudo sh pkg_install_ubuntu.sh -l c++ -l python -l rtshell --yes
 $ sudo rtshell_post_install

Close the terminal once.

*** Raspbian case:
Move to the directory where the bulk installation script is downloaded and type in:
 $ sudo sh pkg_install_raspbian.sh -l c++ -l python -l rtshell --yes
 $ sudo rtshell_post_install

Close the terminal once.

Currently, there is an issue with rtshell_post_install on Raspbian.  The following method can make you avoid the problem.
Before closing the terminal, execute rtshell_post_install without "sudo" prefix. And answer ''N'' to the first and the 2nd question. Then answer ''Y'' to the 3rd question like following:
 Link man pages? n
 Link documentation? n
 Add shell support to .bashrc? y
