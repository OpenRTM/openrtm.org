Communication middleware called CORBA is required to execute OpenRTM-aist-Java. In Java, CORBA functionality was originally included as a standard function, but since Java 9 it is treated as deprecated (the deprecated function that will be removed in the future) and will be completely removed in Java 11 and later. Therefore, to use OpenRTM-aist-Java, it is necessary to use the Java 8 development environment package JDK8.
Original developer Oracle is decreasing the support of JDK8 (Oracle had already stopped the update support for free commercial users and will stop it to non-commercial user in 2020).  But many people still need Java8, so JDK8 itself is available for some time from several vendors. Here, we will introduce how to obtain and install JDK8.

** JDK8 distributors
Here are some of the things we found about distributors of JDK8: Please note that it is only a list of some of the ones we have found, and that there are no intentions, if any, are not listed here. Also, there are various conditions, such as the distribution of each site for paid use and support for the fee, so please check each site before using it.

*** Oracle
As of November 2019, JDK8 download is available from Oracle for the developer and distributor of Java. It seems that personal use and development use have a free license, but commercial use seems to require a paid license. Please refer to the link below and the message from Oracle for the exact license conditions.

** Installation in Linux environment
*** Get the package from the repository
OpenJDK packages equivalent to JDK8 are distributed as standard packages in major Linux distributions.

*** Ubuntu / Debian / Raspbian
On Ubuntu Linux, Debian Linux, etc., you can install using the apt command as follows.
 $ sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk

*** Fedora
In Fedora Linux, you can install with yum command as follows.
 $ sudo yum -y install java-1.8.0-openjdk

*** Other than obtaining the package from the repository
It can also be obtained from the URL of the above third party vendor. Follow the information on the site for the installation method, or install using the standard Java method.

*** When other than JDK8 is already installed
Note that a JDK other than JDK8 may be installed in the default state.
 $ java -version

Make sure that the command version is JDK8, such as the version starting with 1.8.
If not
 $ sudo update-alternative --config java

Use the command to select a Java environment based on JDK8.
The execution example after installing openjdk-8-jdk in the environment of ubuntu18.04 is as follows.
 $ sudo update-alternatives --config java
